# dynamic-xmpp-bot
The demo code of the XMPP bots talk I gave at PyConNG 2017.

# XMPP server
A local [prosody](https://prosody.im/) server, running on an Ubuntu 16.04 in a VirtualBox was set up and used. Then it
was accessed at 192.168.56.151. [echobot](echobot.py) contains the code for the bot. Please search online to know how
to setup the [prosody](https://prosody.im/) server to your taste.

# Running the app
Assuming the [prosody](https://prosody.im/) server is set up and running smoothly, run [echobot](echobot.py). Start
your chat client, I used [adium](https://adium.im/) for this demo.

# Proof of concept
A [png](Screen%20Shot%202017-09-16%20at%204.52.58%20AM.png) was taken to show the application working as expected

# Growing wings
You could add more information to call within the [collectibles](collectibles.py) file. The sky is your limit!
